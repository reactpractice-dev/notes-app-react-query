# React Practice - Build a notes app

Starter repo for [building a Notes App using React Query and json-server](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-notes-app-with-react-query-and-json-server/).

Getting started:

- `npm install` to install the dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the React app
- `npm run backend-server` to start the notes backend built with `json-server`

The Notes API is available at `http://localhost:3000/notes`. You can perform the usual `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` on it.

To run the tests: `npm run test`.
